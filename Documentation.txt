Step 1:
--------
Add new file Azure Fucntions, with name ListWallets
in this file you see the function name and async tasks, this uses http trigger and can perform 
get, post and also we have route where we can specify the route url

the following are the input bindings

for http triggers it is 
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req)

for timer trigger it is
HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)]

for queue triggers it is
[QueueTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] string message)

you can also add output bindings
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req [CosmosDb] out dynamix obj)
and create an obj in the code like

obj = new 
{ id = Guid.NewGuid(), Name = "test"
}

We can have multiple output bindings but only single input bindings

In host.jsaon
we add all the setting or configurations we need

day 3:
------------------------------------------------------------
we create class library project "JVKExpensesTraker .Shared" to communicate between server and client

we add 3 folder
DTO, Respomses, Validators

DTOs are used for transferring data between the server and client, 
validators are used to validate the data being transferred, 
and responses provide feedback and information from the server to the client. 
These components together enhance the reliability, consistency, and maintainability 
of the communication process in a class library.


now we add reference to Server project
open dependencies in server project  --> right click then add reference, select Class library project then OK

 in Server folder create new project JVKExpensesTracker.Server.Data with class library
 this is used for data layer and repositories
 then add this project also to the project refernece in dependcies of  the Server.Functions project

 Add 3 folders to the Server.Data project
 Interfaces, Models , Repositories
