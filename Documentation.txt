Step 1:
--------
Add new file Azure Fucntions, with name ListWallets
in this file you see the function name and async tasks, this uses http trigger and can perform 
get, post and also we have route where we can specify the route url

the following are the input bindings

for http triggers it is 
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req)

for timer trigger it is
HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)]

for queue triggers it is
[QueueTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] string message)

you can also add output bindings
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req [CosmosDb] out dynamix obj)
and create an obj in the code like

obj = new 
{ id = Guid.NewGuid(), Name = "test"
}

We can have multiple output bindings but only single input bindings
